# Fake News Detection System

A machine learning-based system for detecting fake news articles using natural language processing and deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview

This project aims to combat the spread of misinformation by automatically detecting fake news articles. The system uses advanced NLP techniques and deep learning models to analyze text content and determine its veracity.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake_news_detection.git
cd fake_news_detection
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
